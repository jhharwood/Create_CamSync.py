Name:        
Create_CamSync.py

Purpose:      
This script is to be run in the DC_* camera folder created for the RCD30. 
This script will create a CameraSync_%s_0.dat and a CameraSync_%s_R.dat.  
The first file will be used when running CZMIL_Image_Index. 
CZMIL_Image_Index creates it's own CameraSync_%s_T.dat file, 
which is the same as the *_R.dat file but just a name change.  
The point here is the files are the same but chartsPic will recognize 
the files differently and apply the appropriate logic when using chartsPic in pfm3D Edit.

Requirements:  
Python 2.7 (standard library); pyproj, numpy, pandas.  
To run this file you have to have Pandas installed on the machine running the file.
